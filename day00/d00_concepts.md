## Day 00 Concepts

In day00, we mess around with various aspects of the UNIX file system. To learn about the UNIX file system, read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem) and [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-unix-file-system/)

We also are introduced to the concept of a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing). A shell is an interface to the underlying operating system. Using a chosen shell, the exercises ask us to manipulate the file system via various shell commands.
