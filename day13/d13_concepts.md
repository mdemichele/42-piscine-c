## Day 13 Concepts

The key concept of the day is the data structure, known as a **binary tree**

A binary tree is a recursive data structure, made up of nodes. Each node contains a "left" pointer, "right" pointer, and a data element.  The formal recursive definition is:

> A binary tree is either empty (represented by a null pointer), or is made of a single node, where the left and right pointers (recursive definition ahead) each point to a binary tree). [source](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/110/BinaryTrees.html)
